# ETCH-A-SKETCH
Exercise from https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav

In this exercise I will put in practice the knowledge acquired through the HTML, CSS and JS modules, from the course Web Development 101
at The Odin Project (thodinprject.com)

The goal of this project is to build a sketchpad using manipulating the DOM. It is meant to be a difficult task where I will have to find
help in Google quite often.
